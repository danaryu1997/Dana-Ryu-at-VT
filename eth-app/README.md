# Applying Blockchain to COVID-19 Health Status

The topic of the project is verifying people’s COVID-19 health status, including test results and vaccination status using blockchain. The reason behind this is the high demand for verifying people’s records conveniently and correctly. 

## Description

These aspects of blockchain will solve the problem of the previous vaccine verification. 

First, decentralization will distribute the information across the network, other than centralizing only on a few points such as the health organization or the embassy. 

Next, data encryption and decryption will provide transparency and security, unlike the previous method which is easy to falsify.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisite
1. Make sure Ganache is running
2. Make sure Node JS is installed
3. Make sure Metamask is installed


### Executing program
1. Install truffle : npm install -g truffle
2. Migrate : truffle migrate
3. Improve private key from Ganache and import to Metamask
